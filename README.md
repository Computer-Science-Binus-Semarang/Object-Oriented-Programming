The main features are ADT, inheritance, dynamic binding, to perform true polymorphism, generic programming, and others. After completion of this course, student will be able to analyze and construct program using object oriented programming

## Learning Outcomes

- Analysis     : analyze solution for problem solving
- Application  : apply object oriented programming for problem solving
- Application  : design object oriented based program
- Application  : construct program using object oriented programming to solve problem solvin
